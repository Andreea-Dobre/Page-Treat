                        To be honest, we are pretty new in this field. Selling books and encouraging new and ambitious authors to
                        let us help them on their journey of sharing <strong>stories</strong> that they worked on for so long, putting so much 
                        effort in bringing them to life, is pretty terrifing.
                        <br>
                        It required a lot of patience and a lot of work, but we finally gathered all our will and made this website 
                        a reality, so you can now enjoy an online library. 
                        <br>
                        You can sell your books here, or you can buy books, you can see our top picks every week and you can find 
                        out what other readers like yourself enjoy reading.
                        <br>
                        The choice is yours, the stories are infinite and the fun neverending.
                        <br>
                        So stop doing what you're doing and start reading that book <i>you've been dieing to</i> read for so long!
                        <br>
                        And always remember what Ray Bradbury said: 
                        <q>You donâ€™t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.</q>
